## Context

This project is designed to address the challenges faced by equestrian professionals, specifically horse riding trainers and riders. The project aims to leverage technology to provide solutions that enhance the practice of dressage[^1], an equestrian discipline characterized by precise and harmonious movements executed by the rider and the horse.

Dressage is known for its abstract nature, requiring riders to have a clear mental representation of their routine and execute movements with precision and elegance. The discipline takes place in a rectangular dressage arena with letters placed at the corners to guide the rider. Dressage routines encompass various elements such as circles, curves, and changes of pace, all of which must be executed flawlessly.

The primary challenge in dressage lies in the abstract nature of the discipline, as riders need to communicate their requests effectively to the horse while maintaining proper posture and balance. Currently, the primary visual markers available to riders during official competitions are the dressage letters placed in the arena. In some cases, a rider may receive verbal instructions to guide their routine.

The MEEM'HROSE[^2] project aims to tackle this challenge by leveraging technology to provide riders with an innovative solution. By incorporating digital tools and advancements, the project seeks to offer riders enhanced support and assistance in executing dressage routines with precision and accuracy. The proposed solution will bridge the gap between the abstract nature of dressage and the need for clear visual guidance, thereby revolutionizing the practice of dressage and improving performance for riders.

### V. Glossary

[^1]: Dressage involves developing horses to showcase the elegance of their movements and their ease of use. In competitions, the performances are based on routines consisting of classical movements and required or freestyle figures, with the horse performing in different gaits. (translated from French)
