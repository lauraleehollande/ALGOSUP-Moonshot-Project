## What problem my project is solving?

My project is for the equestrian professional, specifically for horse riding trainers and riders. As a rider for many years, I have encountered many difficulties that can now be solved by technologies. One of the most difficulty in the equestrian community is the abstract side of the dressage. It is an equestrian discipline where the rider and the horse work together to achieve precise and harmonious movements. These movements are executed on a rectangular dressage arena with letters placed at the corners to guide the rider in their routine. The discipline focuses on precision, elegance, and communication between the rider and the horse. Dressage competitions are judged based on the quality of the movements executed and the fluidity of the performance. A dressage routine includes many elements such as circles, curves, and changes of pace.

The difficulty of this discipline lies in its abstract nature, as the rider must have a clear mental representation of their routine and the movements he wants to execute but also, precision in their requests in order to communicate the correct information to their horse. This requires the rider to be rigorous in their posture, balance, and requests. Indeed, when a rider wishes to perform a dressage routine, they have two aids at their disposal: their routine and the markers in the arena. In official competitions, the only visual markers available to the rider are the dressage letters placed in the arena, although in some cases, it is possible for someone to dictate the routine to the rider.

- By clicking on this [link](https://www.ffe.com/pratiquer/disciplines/dressage), you will be directed to the official website of the French Equestrian Federation where you can find all the official dressage routines in the various drop-down menus labeled **"Reprise"**. You can also navigate on this page to find other information about this discipline.

- These are the dressage markers for a 60 x 20 meter dressage arena. The distances presented are official and never vary. The letters on the centerline (G, I, X, L, D) are not indicated on the arena; they are imaginary markers. The other official size for a dressage arena is 40 x 20 meters.

## Why this problem is worth solving?

The equestrian world is nowadays more and more connected but nothing has been developed to help riders or/and trainers in there physical tasks which has an effect on their physical condition and morale.
There are a number of reasons why developing a solution to place bars for horse work might be considered a problem worth solving:

- **Saving time:** Setting up courses and exercises for horse training can be time-consuming, particularly if you have a large arena or multiple horses to work with. A solution that can place the bars quickly and accurately could help coaches/instructors save time and focus on other aspects of their work.

- **Reducing physical effort:** Setting up courses and exercises can also be physically demanding, particularly if you are handling heavy bars or working in a large arena. A solution that can do this work for you could help to reduce the physical strain on trainers.

- **Improving accuracy:**  A solution that is programmed to place the bars in specific locations could potentially be more accurate than a human, which could be particularly useful for roders and/or trainers who are working on precise exercises or drills.

- **Allowing for more flexibility:** A solution that can place the bars in a variety of different locations could also give trainers and riders more flexibility in terms of the types of courses and exercises they can create. This could allow coaches/instructors to design more varied and challenging workouts for their horses.

## How I am going to solve this problem?

The option would be to have a jumping bar which can move by itself with accuracy. I plan to add rotating ends to the jumping bar
that will enable it to move with the help of sensors placed around the training area. The riders and trainers will also have an acces to an application to plan their exercices ahead and control the bars.
About the technologies I will maybe use Python or C++ for the jumping bar and there is many option to develop an application.
<!--The option would be to use a mobile robot base equipped with a mechanism for picking up and placing the bars. The robot could navigate around the arena using sensors such as cameras or light detection and ranging (LIDAR) to avoid obstacles and locate the desired placement for the bars. The coach/instructor will be able to plan ahead their next sessions and the robot will be able to place it.
There are many different programming languages that you could use to develop a robot, I am considering using Python or C++.
One of the key elements of my project is to offer the possibility to the trainer to plan their session ahead on a logiciel link to the robot. Using a software will bring more precision on the horse's work which needs precise measure. For this part we can imagine a software will work with a graphical user interface.-->
