# Overview of the project
My project aims to solve one of the major problems of the equestrian world, more precisely on the training of the horse: the placement of the pole work exercises, an essential exercise for the training of the horse.
For this, I am working on the project of a bar that would be able to move by itself and return to its defined place with precision when the horse kicks the exercise.
There are several reasons why it might be considered a problem worth solving:
Saving time
Reducing physical effort
Improving accuracy
Allowing for more flexibility

# What is done
The [roadmap and planning](https://github.com/lauraleehollande/ALGOSUP-Moonshot-Project/blob/main/README.md)
Free access to horse jumping bars for testing, prototyping…
The [first specification](https://github.com/lauraleehollande/ALGOSUP-Moonshot-Project/blob/main/Documents/Specification.md)

# What I am currently working on
Functional specifications (v1)
Technical specifications (v1)
One or two surveys to know:
The use of the telephone on horseback
Riders' and instructors' session preparation habits
Budget planification
