## What problem my project is solving

The goal of my project is to work with people suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. It is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of memory and certain intellectual functions leading to repercussions in the activities of daily living. 
With my project, I would like to act with Alzheimer’s people and offer them to go back to their past via known places and environments. The goal is to recreate a connection with their past and hope to create reactions. 
Here, the goal is to stimulate one of the 5 senses of the human body: the vision. It will allow us to get a reaction from people who today no longer speak, no longer react, and have become dependent.

## Why this problem is worth solving

 It has been shown that our memory is linked to our 5 senses: vision, touch, smell, hearing, and taste. Stimulating one or more of these senses in an elderly person can cause one or more reactions. 
 This was observed with [Marta C. Gonzalez](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-nov-16-2020-1.5803389/who-was-this-mysterious-ballerina-from-the-viral-swan-lake-video-1.5803747), a former prima ballerina who now had Alzheimer’s disease. Thanks to an excerpt from Tchaikovsky’s “Swan Lake”, this elderly person who no longer spoke remembered her past, then spoke and moved. Today 1.2 million people are affected by Alzheimer’s disease in France and it will affect 2.2 million people in 2050. It is also the second most feared disease by the French after cancer. This disease is at the heart of the current preoccupations, difficult to treat for the nursing staff but also hard to live with for the affected persons and their entourage. Successfully recreating places where people with Alzheimer’s disease have lived could stimulate visual memory and create a reaction in a person who has little or no reaction to his environment. Of course, this project is intended for people with Alzheimer but it could be extended to the elderly and even in other sectors.

## How I am going to solve this problem

Regarding the technologies, there will be VR and considering the VR project, I think I will use Unity and C#. The interest of my project is that the creation of the scene is relatively fast, even instantaneous. It is not placing each element of the scene one by one but that it is auto-generated thanks to a data bank. 
I think the use of other languages like Python is also possible, but also visual detection could have an important role to play.
