## What problem my project is solving?

My project is for the equestrian professional, specifically for horse riding coaches/instructors. As a rider for many years, I have noticed a recurring problem, the placement of equestrian material (jumping bars, cones...). This essential task for the horse's work can be a waste of time and a tedious activity, indeed while the coach/instructor is setting up his session he cannot watch the riders preparing the horses and if he chooses to watch them he loses time on his session to set up it. The second point is the arduousness of the task, a session may consist of more than 6 jumping bars to be moved by hand one by one or two by two. In general, jumping bars are designed to be lightweight and "easy to move" so they are typically less than 15 pounds (6.8 kg), which is still heavy, especially on a repeated action.
In this project I will focus on the placement of poles exercises which is basically jumping bars on the floor. It is an essential device in the work of the horse which allows the work of many points.
Here some example of poles exercises:

## Why this problem is worth solving?

The equestrian world is nowadays more and more connected but nothing has been developed to help coaches/instructors in there physical tasks which has an effect on their physical condition and morale. 
There are a number of reasons why developing a solution to place bars for horse work might be considered a problem worth solving:

- **Saving time:** Setting up courses and exercises for horse training can be time-consuming, particularly if you have a large arena or multiple horses to work with. A solution that can place the bars quickly and accurately could help coaches/instructors save time and focus on other aspects of their work.

- **Reducing physical effort:** Setting up courses and exercises can also be physically demanding, particularly if you are handling heavy bars or working in a large arena. A solution that can do this work for you could help to reduce the physical strain on trainers.

- **Improving accuracy:**  A solution that is programmed to place the bars in specific locations could potentially be more accurate than a human, which could be particularly useful for coaches/instructors who are working on precise exercises or drills.

- **Allowing for more flexibility:** A solution that can place the bars in a variety of different locations could also give trainers more flexibility in terms of the types of courses and exercises they can create. This could allow coaches/instructors to design more varied and challenging workouts for their horses.


## How I am going to solve this problem?

The option would be to use a mobile robot base equipped with a mechanism for picking up and placing the bars. The robot could navigate around the arena using sensors such as cameras or light detection and ranging (LIDAR) to avoid obstacles and locate the desired placement for the bars. The coach/instructor will be able to plan ahead their next sessions and the robot will be able to place it.
There are many different programming languages that you could use to develop a robot, I am considering using Python or C++.
One of the key elements of my project is to offer the possibility to the trainer to plan their session ahead on a logiciel link to the robot. Using a software will bring more precision on the horse's work which needs precise measure. For this part we can imagine a software will work with a graphical user interface.
