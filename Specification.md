## What
The goal of my project is to work with people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of memory and certain intellectual functions leading to repercussions in the activities of daily living.
With my project I would like to act with Alzheimer people and propose them to go back to their past via known places and environments. The goal is to recreate a connection with their past and hope to create reactions.
Here, the goal is to stimulate one of the 5 senses of the human body : the vision, to get a reaction from people who today no longer speak, no longer react and have become dependent.

## Why
It has been shown that our memory is linked to our 5 senses: vision, touch, smell, hearing and taste. Stimulating one or more of these senses in an elderly person can cause one or more reactions. 
This was observed with Marta C. Gonzale, a former prima ballerina who now has Alzheimer's disease. Thanks to an excerpt from Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake", this elderly person who no longer spoke, remembered her past and began to speak and move.
Today 1.2 million people are affected by Alzheimer's disease in France and it is thought that it will affect 2.2 million people in 2050. It is also the second most feared disease by the French after cancer. 
This disease is at the heart of the current preoccupations, difficult to treat for the nursing staff but also hard to live for the affected persons and their entourage. Successfully recreating places where people with Alzheimer's disease have lived could stimulate visual memory and create a reaction in a person who has little or no reaction to his environment.
