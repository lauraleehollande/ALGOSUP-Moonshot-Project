## What
The goal of my project is to work with people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of memory and certain intellectual functions leading to repercussions in the activities of daily living.
With my project I would like to act with Alzheimer people and propose them to go back to their past via known places and environments. The goal is to recreate a connection with their past and hope to create reactions.
Here, the goal is to stimulate one of the 5 senses of the human body : the vision, to get a reaction from people who today no longer speak, no longer react and have become dependent.
